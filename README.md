I helped design and build this program as part of a four person team.  It's purpose was to allow a user to enter their zipcode and receive both an up to date weather report and access to a spotify playlist based on the current state of the weather at the user's location.  In theory, if it was sunny out the user might hear a lot of energetic, summertime music.  Or, if it was snowing, the user might hear a number of Christmas songs.

  In essence, we wanted to give the user easy access to music that reflected the type of temperature and precipitation that they were or were not experiencing.
